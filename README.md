# USC Movies Page 🎥
This is a Movies Page project for UNISAGRADO Computer Science course! 🤖

In this responsive web development study we aimed to create a Netflix-like web page where users can:

- Create their own account 👤
- Search for movies 🔍
- Add movies to their Watched List 👁️
- See movies recommendation based on their watch history 🕓

Front-end was developed with React ✨ & Back-end was developed with Python 🐍
For storage we used Google's Firebase 🔥

Hope you enjoy!
